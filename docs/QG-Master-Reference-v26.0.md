<!-- MANDATORY: This filename MUST include the version number (e.g., QG-Master-Reference-v22.0.md). -->
<!-- When bumping the version, RENAME this file to the new version. NEVER use a plain filename without version. -->
<!-- SAFETY: Always use `git fetch origin main` + `git checkout origin/main -- <file>` on VPS. NEVER use `git pull` or `git checkout main`. -->
<!-- SAFETY: Pre-generated export files in data/exports/ are served BEFORE live DB queries. Update generate_exports.py AND regenerate when changing export logic. -->

## ·· STOP · READ BEFORE ANY VPS WORK ··

1. Run `source ~/deploy-guard.sh <world|oil|cyber>` **BEFORE** touching any file on VPS. No exceptions.
2. **NEVER** `git reset --hard` while PM2 is running. It corrupts SQLite databases.
3. **NEVER** `sed`, `python3 -c`, or direct-patch files on VPS. Push to GitHub first, then `git fetch` + `git checkout origin/main -- <file>`.
4. **NEVER** `git pull`. Use `git fetch origin main` + `git checkout origin/main -- <file>`.
5. Run `source ~/deploy-done.sh <world|oil|cyber>` **AFTER** deployment. It restarts PM2 and verifies integrity.
6. If you skip these steps, you will corrupt a database. It has happened on April 6, April 7, and April 8, 2026.

### What's Running on the VM

- PM2 manages 3 Node.js dashboard processes (auto-restarts on crash/reboot)
- Nginx reverse proxy with SSL (subdomain routing)
- Let's Encrypt SSL certificates (auto-renew via certbot timer)
- Auto-update cron: **REMOVED** (April 6, 2026) · The hourly auto-update.sh cron was killing SQLite databases mid-write via `pm2 restart all`. Removed with `crontab -r`. All updates now require manual deployment scripts only.

### PM2 Processes

| ID | Name | Port | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | cyber-dashboard | 5002 | online |
| 1 | world-dashboard | 5001 | online |

## Dashboards

### Oil Markets Index

- **URL:** https://oil.quantitativegenius.com
- **Direct:** http://136.117.206.145:5000
- **Data sources:** Yahoo Finance live (CL=F for WTI, BZ=F for Brent) + FRED historical backfill (DCOILWTICO for WTI, DCOILBRENTEU for Brent) + Yahoo Finance ^GSPC for S&P 500 overlay. See Data Sources & Provenance for full details.
- **Fetch interval:** Every 60 seconds
- **Index scale:** Scaled to S&P 500 range
- **Formula:** `(composite / 147.0) * 5000`
- **Composite weighting:** `(Brent × 0.7) + (WTI × 0.3)` (70% Brent, 30% WTI) · consistent across fetch_oil.py and backfill.py
- **Color scheme:** Brown background, yellow/gold lettering
- **Big number color:** Yellow (#f5c542)
- **Chart overlays:** Oil Composite in gold (#d4af37), S&P 500 in blue (#4488ff) · no separate WTI/Brent lines. Both share a single left Y-axis (no separate right axis).
- **S&P 500 overlay:** Available on ALL time ranges (1H, 1D, 1W, 1Y, MAX). Intra-day data from live fetches; historical from backfill. Starts from January 1987 on MAX view (10,464 records from world DB). Thread 20 fix: removed hardcoded `['1W','1Y','MAX']` filter in frontend that excluded S&P from 1H/1D. Intraday matching uses minute-level keys (`slice(0,16)`) not date-level.
- **API endpoints:** `GET /api/current`, `/api/history`, `/api/sp500-history` (all requireAuth), `GET /api/bitcoin-history` (requireAuth — Thread 24), `GET /api/export/csv`, `/api/export/json` (requirePro), `GET /api/user-tier` (requireAuth), `POST /api/readings` (localhost-only)
- **Pro export UI:** Export button visible only to Pro users in chart header
- **CSV export format:** 5 columns · `date`, `index_value`, `wti_price`, `brent_price`, `bitcoin_price` (Thread 24: bitcoin_price column added; 1 row per trading day, consolidated by generate_exports.py)
- **Daily export cron:** System cron runs `nightly-export.sh` at 4:00 AM UTC (9:00 PM PDT) daily — stops PM2, runs generate_exports.py, restarts PM2 (see Section 21)
- **Export files:** `data/exports/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.{csv,json}`, `data/exports/oil-markets-latest.{csv,json}`, `data/exports/oil-markets-history.{csv,json}`
- **Export serving:** `tryServeFile()` serves pre-generated files first; live DB fallback uses `GROUP BY date(timestamp)` for 1 row/day
- **No market open/closed indicator at top**
- **ATH normalization:** WTI/145.29 × 5000, Brent/146.08 × 5000
- **Historical data:** 9,918 records from May 20, 1987 to present (aligned with Brent FRED start date). WTI: 10,141 rows, Brent: 9,789 rows.
- **Weekly averaging:** MAX and 1Y views use `GROUP BY strftime('%Y-%W')`
- **1Y/MAX latest reading:** Appends current day's most recent reading to prevent being a day behind
- **Deduplication threshold:** 0.01 (lowered from 0.5 to prevent flat lines on 1H/1D/1M)
- **% Change Toggle (Thread 22):** A % button next to the 1H/1D/1W/1Y/MAX time range selectors. Default loads as raw price view. Both Oil Composite and S&P 500 share a single left Y-axis in all modes (no separate right axis · removed in Thread 22 per user request). When toggled to % mode, both lines are normalized to percentage change from their first visible data point. Tooltips show both raw value and % change in both modes. Y-axis shows +0.05% format in % mode. CSS class `.pct-toggle` with `.active` state (green glow). `toPctChange()` function normalizes arrays.
- **Bitcoin overlay (Thread 24):** BTC price fetched from Yahoo Finance BTC-USD every 60 seconds via native Node.js `https.get` in server.js. Stored in `bitcoin_data` table in `oil_markets.db`. Toggle: ₿ button, orange #f7931a, glow when active. Separate right Y-axis in raw mode; shared left Y-axis in % mode. Key commit: 815d02a (nearest-match BTC alignment).
- **BTC independent charting (Thread 27):** BTC continues charting on 1H/1D when oil/S&P markets are closed. Appends real BTC timestamps beyond last main index reading. Index and S&P lines show as gaps (null) during closed hours. Key commit: 3e0108c.

### World Markets Index

- **URL:** https://world.quantitativegenius.com
- **Direct:** http://136.117.206.145:5001
- **Data source:** yfinance (20 country tickers)
- **Index scale:** All three main section scales (World, S&P 500, SSE) scaled in the range of the S&P 500
- **Header text:** Blue "WORLD MARKETS INDEX"
- **Big number font:** DM Sans 700 (bolder/softer)
- **Hero sub-text font:** DM Sans (changed from DM Mono to match bottom time font)
- **Chart overlays:** S&P 500 in blue (#4488ff), SSE in red (#ef4444), World in green (#22c55e)
- **ATH normalization:** S&P: price/7002 × 5000, SSE: price/6124 × 5000
- **Historical data:** 5,669 records from January 4, 2006 to present (trimmed: removed 1/2 and 1/3 entries)
- **CSV export format:** 23 columns · `date`, `composite_value`, then all 20 country prices as individual columns, `bitcoin_price` (Thread 24: bitcoin_price column added; pivoted by generate_exports.py)
- **Weekly averaging:** MAX and 1Y views use `GROUP BY strftime('%Y-%W')`
- **1Y/MAX latest reading:** Appends current day's most recent reading to prevent being a day behind
- **Deduplication threshold:** 0.01 (lowered from 0.5 to prevent flat lines on 1H/1D/1M)
- **Timestamp format:** fetch_data.py uses `datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + 'Z'` (Thread 20 fix: appended Z suffix so Chart.js converts UTC→local time). Frontend also appends Z to labels from the API for consistency.
- **API endpoints:** `GET /api/composite`, `/api/history`, `/api/country-history`, `/api/countries` (all requireAuth), `GET /api/bitcoin-history` (requireAuth — Thread 24), `GET /api/export/csv`, `/api/export/json` (requirePro), `GET /api/user-tier` (requireAuth), `POST /api/readings` (localhost-only)
- **Pro API endpoints:** `GET /api/pro/latest`, `/api/pro/history`, `/api/pro/daily/:date`, `/api/pro/dates` (all requirePro) · serve pre-generated files from `data/exports/` with live DB fallback
- **Daily export cron:** System cron runs `nightly-export.sh` at 4:00 AM UTC (9:00 PM PDT) daily — stops PM2, runs generate_exports.py, restarts PM2 (see Section 21)
- **Export files:** `data/exports/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.{csv,json}`, `data/exports/world-markets-latest.{csv,json}`, `data/exports/world-markets-history.{csv,json}`, `data/exports/world-markets-history-detailed.csv`
- **Pro export UI:** Export button visible only to Pro users in chart header
- **Other Markets section:** Shows "Country · Index Name" on flag hover (not just ticker symbols)
- **Countries (20):** Russia/MOEX removed
- **% Change Toggle (Thread 22):** Same pattern as Oil. A % button next to the time range selectors. Default loads as raw price view showing World (green), S&P 500 (blue), and SSE (red) on the same Y-axis. When toggled to % mode, all three lines are normalized to percentage change from their first visible data point.
- **Bitcoin overlay (Thread 24):** BTC price fetched from Yahoo Finance BTC-USD every 60 seconds via native Node.js `https.get` in server.js. Stored in `bitcoin_data` table in `world_markets.db`. Toggle: ₿ button, orange #f7931a, glow when active. Separate right Y-axis in raw mode; shared left Y-axis in % mode. Key commit: 62d3201 (nearest-match BTC alignment).
- **BTC independent charting (Thread 27):** BTC continues charting on 1H/1D when world markets are closed. Appends real BTC timestamps beyond last main index reading. World, S&P, and SSE lines show as gaps (null) during closed hours. Key commit: 9d94c68.

## Data Sources & Provenance

> **CRITICAL · Locked Down April 7, 2026 (Thread 19).** The data below represents the verified build. All record counts, date ranges, and sources were confirmed against the live VPS databases. Any future changes to data sources must be documented here with date, reason, and new record counts.

### Oil Markets Index · Data Sources

**WTI Crude Oil:**

| Priority | Source | Ticker/ID | Date Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Primary (live + recent) | Yahoo Finance | CL=F (NYMEX WTI Crude Futures) | ~August 23, 2000 to present | More accurate futures price; fetched every 60s |
| Secondary (historical) | FRED | DCOILWTICO (Cushing, OK WTI Spot Price FOB) | January 2, 1986 to present | https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.csv?id=DCOILWTICO |

**Brent Crude Oil:**

| Priority | Source | Ticker/ID | Date Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Primary (live + recent) | Yahoo Finance | BZ=F (ICE Brent Crude Futures) | July 30, 2007 to present | More accurate futures price; fetched every 60s |
| Secondary (historical) | FRED | DCOILBRENTEU (Europe Brent Spot Price FOB) | May 20, 1987 to present | https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.csv?id=DCOILBRENTEU |

**Merge Logic:** Use Yahoo Finance ticker where available (more accurate futures price). Use FRED for dates before Yahoo data begins. Where both exist for the same date, Yahoo takes precedence.

**S&P 500 Overlay (for Oil chart):**
- Source: Yahoo Finance ^GSPC · stored in world DB `country_data` table (cross-database dependency)
- Range: January 2, 1987 to present (10,464 records)
- server.js MAX query starts from 1986-01-01 (changed from 2000-01-01 in Thread 19)
- Path: `../world-markets-index-dashboard/data/world_markets.db`

**Verified Record Counts (April 7, 2026):**
- Composite readings: 9,918 (from May 20, 1987)
- WTI price rows: 10,141
- Brent price rows: 9,789
- S&P 500 overlay: 10,464 records (from world DB)

### World Markets Index · Data Sources

- Source: Yahoo Finance via yfinance library · 20 country tickers (see ticker table above)
- Live fetch interval: 60 seconds
- Backfill start: DB trimmed to start January 4, 2006 (removed 1/2 and 1/3 entries)
- S&P 500 data: Also backfilled to January 2, 1987 (4,795 additional records from Yahoo ^GSPC) for cross-database use by Oil dashboard

**Verified Record Counts (April 7, 2026):**
- Composite readings: 5,669 (from January 4, 2006)
- Country data rows: includes all 20 countries
- S&P 500 in country_data: 10,464 records (from 1987-01-02)
- CSV export: 23 columns (date, composite_value, 20 country price columns, bitcoin_price — Thread 24)

### Cybersecurity Threat Index · Data Sources

- Source: Perplexity Computer daily research + scoring
- Seed data: seed_data.py (deterministic random seed 42) for historical months
- Events column: Populated by add_events.py
- DB columns: year, month, score, level, events

**Verified Record Counts (April 7, 2026):**
- Monthly scores: 125 (from January 2016)
- CSV columns: year, month, score, level, events
- JSON includes: threat_distribution array

### Bitcoin Data Source (Thread 24)

- Source: Yahoo Finance BTC-USD via native Node.js `https.get` (NOT yfinance Python)
- Fetch interval: Every 60 seconds in server.js
- Database: `bitcoin_data` table (`timestamp TEXT`, `price REAL`) in both `oil_markets.db` and `world_markets.db`
- Dedup: Only stores if price changes ≥ 0.01%
- API: `GET /api/bitcoin-history?range=1H|1D|1W|1Y|MAX`
- Data accumulates from first deploy forward (no backfill)

### Data Source Change Log

## Cron Jobs & Automation

### On the Google Cloud VM

- Hourly auto-update: **REMOVED** (April 6, 2026) · Was `~/auto-update.sh` running `pm2 restart all` hourly. This caused recurring SQLite database corruption by killing processes mid-write. Disabled with `crontab -r`.
- **Nightly export cron (Thread 25):** System crontab runs `/home/support/nightly-export.sh` at `0 4 * * *` (4:00 AM UTC / 9:00 PM PDT). Stops Oil + World PM2 processes, runs both `generate_exports.py` scripts sequentially, restarts dashboards, health checks. Logs to `/home/support/nightly-export.log`. Replaces the old PM2-based `oil-export-cron` and `world-export-cron` processes (which were unreliable — PM2 `cron_restart` doesn't fire for stopped processes).

### On Perplexity Computer

## How to Restore Everything from Scratch

### Step 1: Create a new VM

```bash
# Google Cloud Console > Compute Engine > Create Instance
# Name: quantgenius-server
# Zone: us-west1-b
# Machine: e2-micro
# OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
# Disk: 30GB standard
# Allow HTTP + HTTPS traffic
```

### Step 2: Add firewall rule

```bash
# VPC Network > Firewall > Create Rule
# Name: allow-dashboards
# Targets: All instances
# Source: 0.0.0.0/0
# Protocols: TCP 5000,5001,5002
```

### Step 3: SSH in and run setup

```bash
# Install Node.js, PM2, Python, Nginx
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash
sudo apt install -y nodejs nginx python3-pip
sudo npm install -g pm2
pip3 install yfinance pandas

# Clone all 3 repos
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/CybersecurityAnnouncementDotcom/oil-markets-index-dashboard.git
git clone https://github.com/CybersecurityAnnouncementDotcom/world-markets-index-dashboard.git
git clone https://github.com/CybersecurityAnnouncementDotcom/cybersecurity-threat-index-dashboard.git

# Install dependencies
cd ~/oil-markets-index-dashboard && npm install
cd ~/world-markets-index-dashboard && npm install
cd ~/cybersecurity-threat-index-dashboard && npm install

# Backfill databases
cd ~/cybersecurity-threat-index-dashboard && python3 seed_data.py
cd ~/oil-markets-index-dashboard && python3 backfill.py
cd ~/world-markets-index-dashboard && python3 backfill.py

# Start all dashboards with PM2
cd ~/oil-markets-index-dashboard && pm2 start server.js --name oil-dashboard -- --port 5000
cd ~/world-markets-index-dashboard && pm2 start server.js --name world-dashboard -- --port 5001
cd ~/cybersecurity-threat-index-dashboard && pm2 start server.js --name cyber-dashboard -- --port 5002

# Set PM2 to auto-start on reboot
pm2 save
sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin pm2 startup systemd -u support --hp /home/support
pm2 save
```

### Step 3b: Create swap file (MANDATORY for e2-micro)

```bash
fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
chmod 600 /swapfile
mkswap /swapfile
swapon /swapfile
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' >> /etc/fstab
# Verify
free -h  # Should show Swap: 2.0Gi
```

### Step 4: Set up Nginx + SSL

```bash
sudo apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d oil.quantitativegenius.com -d world.quantitativegenius.com -d cyber.quantitativegenius.com --non-interactive --agree-tos -m jq_007@yahoo.com
```

### Step 5: Backfill S&P 500 pre-2006 data

The world backfill only covers 2006+ (when all 20 tickers have data). Oil's S&P overlay needs data back to 2000:

```python
python3 -c "
import yfinance as yf, sqlite3
db = sqlite3.connect('/home/support/world-markets-index-dashboard/data/world_markets.db')
earliest = db.execute(\"SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM country_data WHERE ticker='^GSPC'\").fetchone()[0]
hist = yf.Ticker('^GSPC').history(start='2000-01-01', end=earliest[:10], interval='1d')
for date, row in hist.iterrows():
    ts = date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    price = round(row['Close'], 2)  # RAW price, NOT normalized
    db.execute('INSERT OR IGNORE INTO country_data (timestamp, country, ticker, price, weight, contribution) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)',
               (ts, 'USA', '^GSPC', price, 0.246, 0.0))
db.commit()
db.close()
"
```

> **WARNING:** Do NOT set up an auto-update cron. All updates must use manual deployment scripts.

### Step 6: Update DNS (if IP changed)

- Go to Wix Studio > Domains > quantitativegenius.com > DNS Records
- Update the A records for oil, world, cyber subdomains to the new IP

## How to SSH into the VM

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com
2. Select project quantitativegenius (ID: tonal-affinity-492010-j5)
3. Navigate to Compute Engine > VM Instances
4. Click SSH next to quantgenius-server

### Useful SSH Commands

```bash
pm2 list                      # Check dashboard status
pm2 logs                      # View real-time logs
crontab -l                    # Should show ONLY: 0 4 * * * /home/support/nightly-export.sh
sudo nginx -t                 # Test Nginx config
sudo systemctl restart nginx  # Restart Nginx
sudo certbot renew --dry-run  # Test SSL renewal
free -h                       # Verify swap is active (should show Swap: 2.0Gi)
```

## Key Technical Details

### Data Sources

- Oil & World Dashboards: yfinance (free, no API key needed) + native Node.js https.get for Bitcoin (Thread 24)
- Cybersecurity Dashboard: Perplexity Computer daily research + seed_data.py
- Podcasts: Web research via Perplexity Computer cron jobs

### Important Tickers

- Saudi Arabia: ^TASI.SR (NOT ^TASI)
- China SSE: 000001.SS
- Turkey: XU100.IS
- Italy: FTSEMIB.MI
- Bitcoin: BTC-USD (Yahoo Finance, fetched via Node.js https.get — NOT yfinance)

### Known Issues & Fixes

- `pandas_datareader` has compatibility issues with Python 3.12 · use yfinance directly
- Sawtooth noise on MAX/1Y charts · fixed with weekly averaging (`GROUP BY strftime('%Y-%W')`)
- Glitch protection · servers reject any reading that drops >20% from previous value
- YouTube API uploads require publicly accessible URL for filePath (local paths fail silently)
- 1Y/MAX stale data fix: Both oil and world servers now append the latest reading from today when serving 1Y/MAX data
- Deduplication threshold: Lowered from 0.5 to 0.01 on oil and world to prevent 1H/1D/1M from showing flat lines
- SQLite WAL files: If DB shows stale cached data, delete .db-wal and .db-shm files, then restart PM2
- Oil backfill.py weighting fix (April 3, 2026): backfill.py previously used 60/40 (WTI/Brent) instead of 70/30 (Brent/WTI). Fixed to match fetch_oil.py.
- World backfill.py SCALE_FACTOR fix (April 3, 2026): backfill.py was missing the `SCALE_FACTOR = 0.194715` multiplier that fetch_data.py uses.
- Cross-dashboard dependency (April 6, 2026): Oil's `/api/sp500-history` reads from the WORLD database (`country_data` table, `^GSPC`). If the world DB is corrupt or missing, both dashboards lose their S&P 500 overlay lines.
- NEVER use `git reset --hard` on VPS · Known Issue #12 (April 8, 2026)
- deploy-guard.sh is MANDATORY before any VPS file modification · Known Issue #14 (April 8, 2026)
- After world DB restore, must re-backfill S&P 500 pre-2006 data · Known Issue #15 (April 8, 2026)
- Always deploy code to VPS after pushing to GitHub · Known Issue #16 (April 8, 2026)
- World MAX CSV date filter fix (Thread 24): Pre-generated export file in data/exports/ was stale, showing rows starting 2006-01-02 instead of correct 2006-01-04. Fix: re-ran `python3 generate_exports.py` on VPS.
- NEVER run `generate_exports.py` while PM2 dashboards are running · Known Issue #17 (Thread 25, April 10, 2026): Python export scripts consume enough memory to OOM-crash the 1GB VPS. The nightly export cron (`nightly-export.sh`) stops PM2 first. If running manually, use `deploy-guard` first.
- Oil WAL mode fix · Known Issue #18 (Thread 25, April 10, 2026): Oil’s SQLite was in `delete` journal mode while World used `wal`. This caused ~18% of Oil fetch attempts to fail with "database is locked" when reads/writes collided. Fixed: `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`. All databases now use WAL.
- PM2 `cron_restart` doesn’t fire for stopped processes · Known Issue #19 (Thread 25, April 10, 2026): The old `oil-export-cron` and `world-export-cron` PM2 processes were in "stopped" state, meaning PM2 never triggered them at 23:55 UTC. Replaced with system crontab.
- VPS rebooted 3 times in 10 days (Apr 1, Apr 8, Apr 10) · Known Issue #20 (Thread 25): Apr 10 reboot caused by running `generate_exports.py` via screen while all dashboards were active. Load spiked to 52, OOM killed processes.

### Thread 24 · Bitcoin Overlay + OOM Crash Fix + CSV Date Filter Fix

- **Bitcoin overlay** added to both Oil and World dashboards (see Section 18)
- **OOM Crash Fix**: 2GB swap file documented and verified (see Section 19)
- **CSV Date Filter Fix**: World MAX CSV stale export repaired (see Section 20)
- GitHub commits: World 62d3201 (nearest-match BTC), Oil 815d02a (nearest-match BTC)

### Thread 25 · WAL Mode, Nightly Export Cron, PM2 Cleanup, Bitcoin Backfill (April 10, 2026)

- **Oil Bitcoin backfill**: Ran `backfill_bitcoin.py` on Oil — populated 4,649 BTC records from 2014-09-17 to present. Oil previously only had ~424 real-time BTC rows.
- **OOM crash (Apr 10)**: Running `generate_exports.py` via screen while all 3 dashboards were active spiked load to 52 and OOM-killed processes. Killed runaway Python, restarted Oil dashboard.
- **WAL mode on Oil**: Oil’s SQLite was using `delete` journal mode (causing ~18% fetch failures from lock conflicts). Switched to `wal` to match World. All databases now use WAL.
- **Nightly export cron**: Created `/home/support/nightly-export.sh` — stops Oil + World PM2, runs both `generate_exports.py` sequentially, restarts, health checks. System cron at `0 4 * * *` (4:00 AM UTC / 9:00 PM PDT). Logs to `/home/support/nightly-export.log`.
- **PM2 cleanup**: Removed old `oil-export-cron` (PM2 ID 4) and `world-export-cron` (PM2 ID 3). PM2 now has 3 processes only: cyber(0), world(1), oil(2).
- **Methodology PDFs updated**: Oil v4.0, World v4.0, Cyber v3.2 — pushed to all 3 repos + VPS.
- **QG reference docs updated**: Master v25.0, Deploy v7.0, Security v1.2.
- **Documentation Deployment section** (Section 17) added to QG-Deployment-Guide.

### Thread 26 · 10x Pricing Increase, New Stripe Prices & Payment Links (April 11, 2026)

- **10x pricing increase**: All subscription prices increased 10x. New 4-tier structure: Individual Basic $390/mo, Individual Pro $590/mo, All-Access Basic $790/mo, All-Access Pro $990/mo.
- **New Stripe prices**: Created new Stripe price objects for all 4 products (Oil, World, Cyber, Bundle) × 4 tiers (Basic Monthly, Basic Yearly, Pro Monthly, Pro Yearly) = 16 new price IDs. Saved to `new-stripe-prices.json`.
- **New Stripe payment links**: Created corresponding payment links for all 16 new prices. Saved to `new-payment-links.json`.
- **Hidden pricing pages**: Two hidden pricing HTML pages deployed to VPS at obfuscated URLs (not linked from main site). These contain the new payment links.
- **Legacy prices preserved**: Old $59/$590 price IDs kept active for any existing subscribers.
- **QG-Deployment-Guide updated**: Section 13 now shows new pricing table with legacy IDs below.
- GitHub commits: Oil 80f2888, World 1587371, Cyber e92ddbd (docs: pricing table update)

### Thread 27 · BTC Independent Charting Fix (April 11, 2026)

- **BTC independent charting**: BTC trades 24/7 but was previously mapped only onto main index timestamps. When oil/S&P/world markets closed, BTC flatlined or disappeared. Fix appends real BTC timestamps beyond the last main reading so the BTC line continues live during off-hours. Index/S&P lines show as gaps (null) during closed hours — accurate behavior.
- **Oil commit:** 3e0108c — `public/index.html` (24 lines added)
- **World commit:** 9d94c68 — `public/index.html` (26 lines added)
- **QG reference docs updated**: Master v26.0, Deploy v8.0, Security v1.3, Account Recovery updated.
- **Methodology PDFs updated**: Oil v4.1, World v4.1, Cyber v3.3.

## Database Protection & Recovery

### Purpose

The deploy-guard system prevents the three most common causes of SQLite database corruption:

| Incident | Date | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| DB corruption #1 | April 6, 2026 | Auto-update cron ran `git pull` mid-write |
| DB corruption #2 | April 7, 2026 | Stale branch checkout overwrote DB file |
| DB corruption #3 | April 8, 2026 | `git reset --hard` executed while PM2 process was running |

### deploy-guard.sh — MANDATORY BEFORE ANY VPS FILE MODIFICATION

Location: `/home/support/deploy-guard.sh`

```bash
source ~/deploy-guard.sh <world|oil|cyber>
```

Steps performed:
1. **Stop PM2 process** for the relevant dashboard — ensures no active writes to the database.
2. **Back up the database** with a timestamp suffix (e.g., `readings.db.2026-04-08T14-32-00.bak`).
3. **Run `PRAGMA integrity_check`** on the database.
4. **Abort with error** if the integrity check does not return `ok`.

### deploy-done.sh — MANDATORY AFTER DEPLOYMENT

Location: `/home/support/deploy-done.sh`

```bash
source ~/deploy-done.sh <world|oil|cyber>
```

Steps performed:
1. **Restart the PM2 process** for the relevant dashboard.
2. **HTTP health check** — sends a request to the dashboard and confirms HTTP 200.
3. **DB integrity check** — runs `PRAGMA integrity_check` post-restart.

### Recovery Procedure

After any world DB restore from backup:

1. Check: `SELECT MIN(timestamp), COUNT(*) FROM country_data WHERE ticker='^GSPC'` — must start at 1987-01-02 with ~10,400+ records
2. If starting at 2000 or later, run the S&P 500 pre-2006 backfill script
3. Verify the Oil MAX chart shows S&P line starting at 1987

### WAL Mode

All QG SQLite databases run in Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode:

```sql
PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;
```

---

## API Key System

### Key Format

```
qg_<32 random hex characters>
```

### Storage Model

| Data | How Stored |
|---|---|
| Full plaintext key | **Never stored** — shown to user once at generation, then discarded |
| Key hash | SHA-256 of the full key, stored in `api_keys` table |
| Display prefix | First 8 characters stored as `key_prefix` for UI display only |

### Key Lifecycle

- Each user may have **one active key** at a time.
- Generating a new key **immediately revokes** the previous key (old hash deleted from table).
- Keys can be explicitly deleted via `DELETE /auth/api-key`.

### Per-Product Access Control

API key validation is product-scoped. Each dashboard passes its own Stripe product ID when validating:

```
GET /auth/validate-key?key=qg_...&product=prod_XXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Auth Endpoints Summary

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/auth/api-key` | Generate new key (revokes old) |
| `DELETE` | `/auth/api-key` | Revoke current key |
| `GET` | `/auth/api-key-status` | Return key prefix and active status |
| `GET` | `/auth/validate-key?key=...&product=...` | Validate key + subscription for a product |

## Master Calculations Reference

### Oil Markets Index Formula

```
composite = (brent_price × 0.7) + (wti_price × 0.3)
index_value = (composite / 147.0) × 5000
```

- WTI ATH normalization: WTI/145.29 × 5000
- Brent ATH normalization: Brent/146.08 × 5000
- Composite weighting: 70% Brent, 30% WTI (consistent across fetch_oil.py and backfill.py)

### World Markets Index Formula

```
contribution = price × weight × SCALE_FACTOR
SCALE_FACTOR = 0.194715
```

- All 20 country weights sum to exactly 1.000
- USA weight: 0.246 (not 0.245)
- S&P ATH: price/7002 × 5000
- SSE ATH: price/6124 × 5000

### Glitch Protection

Incoming readings are validated before insertion. A reading is **rejected** if it represents a drop of more than **20%** from the most recent stored value.

### Duplicate Prevention

A reading is **silently skipped** if the change from the previous value is less than **0.01 points** (index) or **0.01%** (Bitcoin).

## Bitcoin Overlay (Thread 24)

### Overview

Both the Oil Markets Index and World Markets Index dashboards now include a Bitcoin (BTC) price overlay on their charts. This was implemented in Thread 24.

### Data Source

- **Source:** Yahoo Finance BTC-USD ticker
- **Method:** Native Node.js `https.get` — NOT yfinance Python
- **Fetch interval:** Every 60 seconds in `server.js`
- **Why Node.js, not yfinance:** Bitcoin price is fetched on the server-side in the same process as the dashboard, avoiding an additional Python subprocess. This is consistent with the existing architecture where server.js manages the data collection loop.

### Database

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| Table name | `bitcoin_data` |
| Schema | `timestamp TEXT, price REAL` |
| Database (Oil) | `oil_markets.db` |
| Database (World) | `world_markets.db` |
| Dedup rule | Only stores a new row if price has changed ≥ 0.01% from the last stored reading |
| Backfill (Oil) | 4,649 historical records from 2014-09-17 to present via `backfill_bitcoin.py` (Thread 25) |
| Backfill (World) | None — BTC data accumulates from first deploy forward |

### API Endpoint

```
GET /api/bitcoin-history?range=1H|1D|1W|1Y|MAX
```

Protected by `requireAuth` middleware. Available on both Oil and World dashboards.

### Frontend Matching Algorithm

**For 1H and 1D ranges — Nearest-match within ±2 minutes:**

BTC readings are matched to index readings using binary search on a sorted array of BTC timestamps.

```javascript
// Constants
const BTC_MAX_GAP = 2 * 60 * 1000; // 2 minutes in milliseconds

// BTC data sorted ascending by timestamp
const btcSorted = [...btcData].sort((a, b) => new Date(a.t) - new Date(b.t));

// Binary search for nearest BTC reading
function findNearestBtc(targetTime, btcSorted) {
    // Binary search implementation
    // Returns nearest BTC price if within BTC_MAX_GAP, otherwise null
}
```

Remaining gaps after the ±2 minute window are legitimate — caused by the BTC dedup filter (price unchanged ≥ 0.01%).

**For 1W, 1Y, and MAX ranges — Date-level matching:**

```javascript
// BTC data keyed by YYYY-MM-DD date string
const btcDateMap = {};
btcData.forEach(b => {
    const dateKey = b.t.slice(0, 10); // YYYY-MM-DD
    btcDateMap[dateKey] = b.price;
});
```

### Algorithm Evolution

| Attempt | Method | Result |
|---|---|---|
| First attempt | Minute-only matching (exact minute key) | ~38% gaps — too many misses |
| Final | Nearest-match ±2 min via binary search | Remaining gaps are legitimate (BTC dedup filter) |

### UI/UX

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Toggle button | ₿ symbol |
| Button color | Orange #f7931a |
| Glow when active | Yes |
| Y-axis (raw mode) | Separate right Y-axis (BTC ~$80k vs index ~1–7k) |
| Y-axis (% mode) | Shared left Y-axis (both normalized to % change) |

### CSV Exports

The `bitcoin_price` column is added to both Oil and World export CSVs:

- **Oil CSV:** `date, index_value, wti_price, brent_price, bitcoin_price`
- **World CSV:** `date, composite_value, [20 country columns], bitcoin_price`

### BTC Independent Charting (Thread 27 · April 11, 2026)

BTC trades 24/7 but the chart previously mapped BTC data points onto main index timestamps only. When oil/S&P/world markets closed, BTC would flatline or disappear from the chart. The fix appends real BTC timestamps beyond the last main index reading, so the BTC line continues showing live price movement during off-hours. Index and S&P lines render as gaps (null) during closed hours — this is accurate since those markets are not trading.

## OOM Crash Fix (Thread 24 / April 8, 2026)

### Incident Summary

All three PM2 processes were killed by the Linux kernel OOM (Out of Memory) killer. The e2-micro VPS had only 1GB RAM and no swap file configured. Running 3 Node.js servers, 2 Python fetchers, Google Ops Agent, nginx, and snapd simultaneously exhausted all physical memory. The kernel OOM killer cascaded into a full system freeze. GCP auto-rebooted the VM; all three sites were down for approximately 7 hours.

### Root Cause

- e2-micro VM: 958MB RAM
- No swap file
- Memory consumers: 3 Node.js dashboard processes + 2 Python fetchers + Google Ops Agent + nginx + snapd
- yfinance can spike memory during bulk historical data fetches

### Fix

Created a 2GB swap file at `/swapfile`, made persistent via `/etc/fstab`.

```bash
fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
chmod 600 /swapfile
mkswap /swapfile
swapon /swapfile
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' >> /etc/fstab
```

### Verification

```bash
# Verify swap is active
free -h
# Expected output includes: Swap:  2.0Gi

# Verify swap survives reboots
grep swap /etc/fstab
# Expected: /swapfile none swap sw 0 0
```

### Status

Swap file is permanent (persists across reboots via /etc/fstab). This fix is also documented in the Security Reference (Section 9) and is part of the monthly monitoring checklist.

## CSV Export Date Filter Fix (Thread 24)

### Problem

The World dashboard MAX CSV export was showing rows starting `2006-01-02` instead of the correct first trading day `2006-01-04`. The database was correctly trimmed to start at 2006-01-04 (done in Thread 19), but the pre-generated export file in `data/exports/` was stale and had not been regenerated after the trim.

### Root Cause

Pre-generated export files in `data/exports/` are served before live DB queries (via `tryServeFile()`). After the Thread 19 database trim removed the 1/2 and 1/3 rows, the pre-generated CSV was not regenerated — it continued to serve the old file with the incorrect start date.

### Fix

Re-ran `generate_exports.py` directly on the VPS:

```bash
source ~/deploy-guard.sh world
cd /home/support/world-markets-index-dashboard
python3 generate_exports.py
source ~/deploy-done.sh world
```

### Prevention

The nightly export cron (`nightly-export.sh`) runs `generate_exports.py` automatically at 4:00 AM UTC (9:00 PM PDT) daily. However, after any manual database modification (trim, restore, backfill), the export files must be regenerated immediately rather than waiting for the nightly cron.

**Rule:** After any database trim, restore, or schema change affecting the export output, immediately run `python3 generate_exports.py` on the VPS (after stopping PM2 via deploy-guard).

---

## Nightly Export Cron (Thread 25)

### Overview

The nightly export cron replaces the old PM2-based `oil-export-cron` and `world-export-cron` processes. Those PM2 crons were unreliable — PM2’s `cron_restart` only fires for processes in "online" state, and both had drifted to "stopped" status, meaning exports never ran.

### How It Works

A system crontab entry runs `/home/support/nightly-export.sh` at 4:00 AM UTC (9:00 PM PDT) daily:

1. **Stop** Oil and World PM2 dashboards (prevents OOM — Python exports + Node.js dashboards exceed 1GB RAM)
2. **Run** Oil `generate_exports.py` (with 120s timeout)
3. **Run** World `generate_exports.py` (with 120s timeout)
4. **Restart** Oil and World PM2 dashboards
5. **Health check** — verifies HTTP 200 from both dashboards
6. **Save PM2 state** — `pm2 save`

Cyber dashboard stays running throughout (it has no exports).

### Downtime Window

Oil and World dashboards are offline for approximately 30 seconds each night at 9:00 PM PDT during the export run.

### Files

| File | Location |
|---|---|
| Export script | `/home/support/nightly-export.sh` |
| Log file | `/home/support/nightly-export.log` |
| System crontab | `crontab -l` as `support` user |
| Cron expression | `0 4 * * *` (4:00 AM UTC / 9:00 PM PDT) |

### Verification

```bash
# Verify cron is installed
crontab -l
# Expected: 0 4 * * * /home/support/nightly-export.sh

# Check last export run
tail -20 /home/support/nightly-export.log
```

### Why Not PM2 Cron?

PM2’s `cron_restart` feature has a critical limitation: it only triggers for processes in "online" state. The export scripts are designed to run once and exit (not stay running), so PM2 marks them as "stopped" after completion. Once stopped, PM2 never re-triggers them. A system crontab doesn’t have this limitation.

Additionally, PM2 `cron_restart` cannot stop other PM2 processes before running — the export scripts must run with dashboards stopped to avoid OOM on the memory-constrained VPS.

---

## WAL Mode Fix (Thread 25)

### Problem

Oil’s SQLite database was using `delete` journal mode (the legacy default), while World’s was using `wal` (Write-Ahead Logging). In `delete` mode, a write operation locks the entire database file. Since Oil’s server writes a new reading every 60 seconds AND serves API requests (reads) concurrently, ~18% of fetch attempts were failing with "database is locked" errors.

### Fix

Switched Oil’s database to WAL mode:

```sql
sqlite3 /home/support/oil-markets-index-dashboard/data/oil_markets.db 'PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;'
```

This is a one-time, non-destructive change. WAL mode persists across database opens — it only needs to be set once.

### Current State

All QG SQLite databases now use WAL mode:

| Database | Journal Mode |
|---|---|
| oil_markets.db | WAL |
| world_markets.db | WAL |
| cybersecurity.db | WAL (verify) |

### Verification

```bash
sqlite3 /home/support/oil-markets-index-dashboard/data/oil_markets.db 'PRAGMA journal_mode;'
# Expected: wal
```
